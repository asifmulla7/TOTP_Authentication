# TOTP_Authentication
Two Factor Authentication or 2-Step Verification provides stronger security for your Account by requiring a second step of verification when you sign in. In addition to your password, youâ€™ll also need a code generated by the Google Authenticator app on your phone. This package implements TOTP defined in RFC 6238 #Laravel #PHP
